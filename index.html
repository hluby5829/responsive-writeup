        <h1>Interface Description</h1>
        <p>
            For my public interface, I chose the ordering kiosk inside of Ten One Tea House.
            It's available for public use but not a necessity in every day life (although
            some may disagree).
        </p>
        <p>Here are sketches of the main screens a user sees while ordering:</p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="storyboard-panel">
                <img class="interface-sketch" src="./assets/interface/IMG_0067.jpeg">
                <p>
                    Screen 1. Lets the user know it's a touch pad and they can place
                    an order here.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="storyboard-panel">
                <img class="interface-sketch" src="./assets/interface/IMG_0068.jpeg">
                <p>
                    Screen 2. Continuous scroll to browse menu. Users can filter,
                    search, and see item info here. They can also access their cart using
                    the ever-present blue button.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="storyboard-panel">
                <img class="interface-sketch" src="./assets/interface/IMG_0069.jpeg">
                <p>
                    Screen 3. Shows all the items in the user's cart along with a
                    customizations and running total. Lets users edit their cart and
                    continue browsing items.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="storyboard-panel">
                <img class="interface-sketch" src="./assets/interface/IMG_0070.jpeg">
                <p>
                    Screen 4. Prompts the user to pay using the card reader. Interactive
                    component switches from the touch pad to the card reader located below
                    the screen.

                Interview Questions
                <p class="answer">
                    It seemed like most people going to Ten One were either picking up
                    a Snackpass order or ordering from the kiosk, skipping the in-person interaction
                    entirely.
                </p>
                <p class="answer">
                    For all interviewees who agreed to give feedback, I asked the following questions:
                </p>
                <ul class="answer">
                    <li>How was your experience navigating the order screen?</li>
                    <li>Were you able to find and order the drink you originally wanted to get?</li>
                    <li>Why did you choose to use the ordering kiosk instead of the counter?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                Summary
                <ul class="answer">
                    <li>
                        Most people knew right away that they were supposed to touch to order. Some would
                        also look at the physical menu at the counter before using the kiosk.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A lot of first time users could not find the card reader when it came time to pay.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Of all the people I interviewed, none mentioned any challenges interacting
                        with the screen, even after I observed some of them looking for the card reader.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The most common answer for why they chose to use the kiosk was that it was
                        more convenient.

                <p>
                    Browsing Betty is new to Ten One but not to boba. The problem she has is that
                    she's never interacted with this particular ordering kiosk before. She represents
                    a first time user who knows they like boba but don't go too often, which I found
                    to be common during user interviews.

                    Impatient Ian knows exactly what they want when they go to Ten One. The problem
                    they have is there is no "past order" or favorites filtering available on the
                    kiosk even though it is already connected through Snackpass. They represent a
                    user who frequents Ten One and the ordering kiosk.

                    Browsey Betty is coming back from a pretty tough exam. She is pretty drained
                    but relieved it's over.

                    While walking back to her dorm she passes Ten One Tea and gets a fantastic
                    idea to treat herself to some boba after all her hard work.

                    Betty walks in and chooses the ordering kiosk because she hasn't been here in
                    awhile and wants to browse without talking to the bobarista.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="storyboard-panel">

                <p>
                    She walks up to the kiosk and taps the screen to begin.

                <p>
                    Scrolling through, Betty has a ton of drink options. She scrolls vertically
                    through the menu and clicks some filters.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="storyboard-panel">

                <p>
                    She's found a drink that sounds good and takes her time comparing the different
                    topping options. Then she checks out.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="storyboard-panel">
                <img class="storyboard-img" src="./assets/storyboard/frame-0007.jpg">
                <p>
                    The screen tells her to continue to the card reader but Betty can't seem to
                    find it since this is her first time using the kiosk.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="storyboard-panel">
                <img class="storyboard-img" src="./assets/storyboard/frame-0008.jpg">
                <p>
                    After tapping the screen a couple times, she finally notices the card reader
                    just below the screen.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="storyboard-panel">
                <img class="storyboard-img" src="./assets/storyboard/frame-0009.jpg">
                <p>
                    With her drink paid for, Betty makes her way to the counter to wait for her drink.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="storyboard-panel">

                    Success! The drink is just what she needed to get her mind off that exam. Betty
                    is glad she took a some extra time to compare drink options, too. This might be
                    her new favorite!
